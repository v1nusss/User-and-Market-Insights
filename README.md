# üìä User and Market Reports Analysis  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing **user purchasing behavior and market insights** using a structured dataset. The dataset includes customer demographics, purchasing frequency, churn probability, and sales trends across different regions. The analysis helps identify customer retention strategies, seasonal trends, and business opportunities.  

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset (`user_and_market_reports.csv`) contains key features such as:  
- **Customer Details**: Unique customer IDs and transaction history.  
- **Product Information**: Most frequently purchased categories.  
- **Sales Metrics**: Average order value and lifetime value.  
- **Behavioral Insights**: Purchase frequency, preferred shopping times.  
- **Geographical Insights**: Sales trends across different regions.  
- **Seasonality**: Peak sales periods based on seasonal trends.  
- **Retention Strategies**: Discounts, loyalty programs, and churn probability metrics.  

## **Steps in Data Analysis**  
### üîç **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Checked for missing values and applied forward-fill (`ffill`) to handle them.  
- Basic statistical analysis (`describe()`) to understand data distributions.  

### üìà **2. Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)**  
#### Key Insights:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Purchase Frequency Distribution**  
   - A histogram showing the frequency of customer purchases.  
   - Helps in identifying high-value customers.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Churn Probability by Region**  
   - A box plot visualizing customer churn risk across different regions.  
   - Helps businesses focus on customer retention strategies in high-risk areas.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Average Order Value by Most Frequent Category**  
   - A bar chart displaying spending patterns across product categories.  
   - Useful for inventory and pricing strategies.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lifetime Value vs Churn Probability**  
   - A scatter plot showing customer **lifetime value** vs. **churn probability**.  
   - Helps in predicting customer attrition and improving engagement strategies.  

### üìä **3. Tableau Dashboard Creation**  
The cleaned dataset (`cleaned_user_and_market_reports.csv`) is exported for **interactive visualizations in Tableau**, which includes:  
- **Churn Probability Heatmap**  
- **Sales Trends Across Seasons**  
- **Customer Segmentation by Region & Retention Strategy**  
- **Purchase Time Distribution Analysis**  

## **How to Use This Repository**  
1. **Run the Python notebook in Google Colab** to preprocess and analyze the dataset.  
2. **Use `cleaned_user_and_market_reports.csv` in Tableau** for dashboard creation.  
3. **Explore interactive insights in Tableau** to gain deeper business intelligence.
